# GMaps Management
## What is it?
Description <br>
- It was made with C# and Windows Forms.
- Uses GMaps.


The project presents a dataset of COVID cases by municipality in Colombia, showing information such as codes, departments, coordinates, population, region, etc.
This dataset can be filtered by 3 criteria, categorical by region, string by municipality name and numeric by a range between COVID cases, in addition to displaying different statistical graphs.

On the other hand it has a map for georeferencing, where the markers of the country's municipalities are located, in addition you can add other markers and polygons that will automatically appear on the map.
